Welcome!

This is the code repository for "Visualizing the de Casteljau's Algorithm". 

It was a bonus project for [Tino Weinkauf](https://www.kth.se/profile/weinkauf)'s course ["Introduction to Visualization and Computer Graphics"](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2258?l=en), at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

The website was coded from scratch using the Web Standards, and I used [Greensock](https://greensock.com/) for animating.

The main application's script is er... [`script.js`](https://github.com/tiago-kth/visgraf/blob/main/script.js). The script [`opening.js`](https://github.com/tiago-kth/visgraf/blob/main/opening.js) is simply some unnecessary code for the unnecessary opening page that took some unnecessary amount of time... but it was fun to do too, it's made of 100 cubic Bézier curves slowing morphing and floating around.

I hope to use the main "engine" to build an interactive explainer about de Casteljau's ALgorithm in the future. It is really fascinating, a succession of linear interpolations over line segments that in the end results in beautiful curves.

Besides Tino's lectures, his recommended [Freya Hólmer's video about Bézier Curves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw) was also a great inspiration. She is awesome, check [her webpage](https://acegikmo.com/) and join [her Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/acegikmo).
